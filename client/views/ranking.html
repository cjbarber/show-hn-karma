      <h3>What is this?</h3>
      <p>From a while back: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6291348">Show HN: Highlighting Efforts of Creation from Hacker News.</a></p>
      <p>I then created this site, which refreshes data based on the comments on this thread every 10 minutes, and pulls out people's post and ranks them based on how many other people they have given feedback to.</p>
      <p>This way, people are incented to give feedback to many users to appear on the top of the list, as opposed to just being rated by how cool their project is.</p>
